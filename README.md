# Electoral Crime Under Democracy

This repository contains programs and analysis scripts used for drafting my first dissertation paper, "Electoral Crime Under Democracy: Information Effects from Judicial Decisions in Brazil."

I don't make all data available yet as this project has been submitted for research funding and data management is subject to funding approval. I am, however, happy to address data or research questions you might have. Please email andre.assumpcao@gmail.com for questions.
