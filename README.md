# Electoral Crime Under Democracy

This repository contains programs and analysis scripts used for drafting my first dissertation paper, "Electoral Crime Under Democracy: Information Effects from Judicial Decisions in Brazil."

I don't make all data available as this project contains identifiable individual-level information. However, the data are publicly available, so you can either collect yourself or wait for an unidentified dataset to be made available. I am happy to address other research questions you might have. Please email andre.assumpcao@gmail.com for questions.
