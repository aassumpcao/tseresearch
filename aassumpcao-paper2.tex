\section{Judicial Favoritism of Politicians: Evidence from Small Claim
Courts}\label{title2}}

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Judicial favoritism has long been a subject of research in law,
economics, and political science. However, scholars have mainly focused
on gender and ethnicity bias but have largely ignored whether judges
treat politicians the same way as ordinary citizens. I use a unique
dataset of judicial decisions in small claims courts in the state of São
Paulo, Brazil, where cases are assigned to judges at random, to verify
whether local politicians have a higher winning rate against other
plaintiffs or defendants. I combine empirical strategies in
{[}@ShayoJudicialIngroupBias2011; @AbramsJudgesVaryTheir2012;
@Sanchez-MartinezDismantlingInstitutionsCourt2018{]} Shayo and Zussman
(2011), Abrams, Bertrand, and Mullainathan (2012), and Sanchez-Martinez
(2018) to test random assignment and provide robustness checks against
potential spurious relationships between being a politician and having a
favorable court outcome.

\hypertarget{main-research-question}{%
\subsection{Main research Question}\label{main-research-question}}

Are politicians more likely to receive favorable rulings in small claim
courts?

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Politicians have a higher winning rate at the trial stage in small
  court claims against their counterparts.
\item
  Proximity to elections increases the winning rates for politicians on
  the campaign trail.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Whether politicians have had the case ruled in their favor.
\item
  The amount awarded to (or avoided by) politicians in small claim court
  cases.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{identification-strategy}{%
\subsection{Identification Strategy}\label{identification-strategy}}

Natural experiment. State Courts assign cases at random when the
judicial district has more than one judge on the bench. I follow Abrams,
Bertrand, and Mullainathan (2012) to check random assignment and uncover
partial effects of being a politician on court outcomes.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

São Paulo State Court (TJ-SP) rulings involving candidates running for
office in the State of São Paulo in the 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016
electoral cycles. Judicial district, judge and politicians' individual
characteristics from the TJ-SP, Electoral Court (TSE), and the National
Statistics Office (IBGE).

\hypertarget{contribution-and-literature}{%
\subsection{Contribution and
Literature}\label{contribution-and-literature}}

It is amongst the new, few papers to investigate judicial bias for
individual politicians and it contributes to the literature on the
benefits of political connectedness.
