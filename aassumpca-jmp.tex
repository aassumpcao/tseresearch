\section{Electoral Crimes and Performance: Evidence from
Brazil}\label{title}}

Andre Assumpcao

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Office-seeking politicians employ various tactics to get elected,
including actions banned by electoral oversight agencies. Using an
unique dataset on candidate eligibility constructed from judicial
decisions of the Brazilian Electoral Court (TSE), I estimate the impact
of electoral code violations on performance at the municipal elections
of 2012 and 2016. I recover causal effects of violations using an unique
feature from Brazil's electoral system in which candidates run for
office, and can be voted on election day, even if the Electoral Court
has not issued a final decision on whether their candidacies met all
code requirements.

\hypertarget{main-research-question}{%
\subsection{Main Research Question}\label{main-research-question}}

Do politicians who violate electoral code perform well at the ballot?

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Candidates who have clean records will perform better at municipal
  elections.
\item
  The effect of infractions is stronger (more negative) if the number of
  clean-record opponents in the race is higher.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Whether candidate was the most voted in mayor elections or last
  candidate voted in in city council elections (equivalent to being
  elected had all their candidacies been valid).
\item
  Vote share.
\item
  Vote distance to elected candidates.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{identification-strategy}{%
\subsection{Identification Strategy}\label{identification-strategy}}

IV where the the instrumented (explanatory) variable is the candidacy
decision issued by the Electoral Court before the elections (trial
stage) and the instrument is the decision issued after the elections
(appeals stage) for all candidates who appealed their decision to run
but have not had a final ruling before election day.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

Election results, candidate, judge, and municipal controls for 2012 and
2016 municipal elections in Brazil. All available at various Electoral
Court (TSE) websites.

\hypertarget{contribution-and-literature}{%
\subsection{Contribution and
literature}\label{contribution-and-literature}}

It contributes the causal effect of electoral violations to previous
works on determinants of electoral performance; in addition, it employs
new identification strategy and dataset (analysis of judicial decisions
regarding elections).
